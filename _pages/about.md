My name is Zhuochen Fan. I received my Ph.D. in computer science from [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), where I also continued my postdoctoral research. Prof. [Tong Yang](https://yangtonghome.github.io/) supervised me both during my Ph.D. studies and postdoctoral period. Currently, I serve as an associate researcher (and also a doctoral supervisor) at [Pengcheng Laboratory (PCL)](https://www.pcl.ac.cn/).
- Research Area: New Data Structures & Algorithms in Network Measurement, Databases, Data Mining, and etc.
