My name is Zhuochen Fan (樊卓宸in Chinese). I graduated from [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) with a Ph.D. in Computer Science and continued my postdoctoral research there, both under the supervision of Prof. [Tong Yang](https://yangtonghome.github.io/). Currently, I serve as an associate researcher (and also a doctoral supervisor) at [Pengcheng Laboratory (PCL)](https://www.pcl.ac.cn/). My research covers various aspects of computer networks, ranging from measurement, storage, and security to architecture, as well as exploring their connections with Large Language Models.

我博士毕业于北京大学，随后继续在本校进行了两年的博士后研究；我目前是鹏城国家实验室的副研究员、博士生导师（“PCL-中山大学”和“PCL-清华大学深圳研究生院”联培专项的PCL博导）；我的研究涵盖计算机网络的多个分支，如测量、存储、安全、架构，并探索这些方向与大语言模型（LLMs）的深度融合。
